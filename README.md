# Android example : SQLite and more #

**Main branch is dev**

**This program has a lot of inperfections and French. This is because it is a college project. I will translate any file in the repo, all you have to do is ask!**



This is a single-man college project where I had certain requirements : 

    At least two activities
    A service
    A Broadcast Receiver
    A Content Provider
    A SQLite database, interfaced by the Content Provider
    An option menu
    Preferences
    At least one Toast
    A toolbar
    A fragment
    A ListView working with an Adapter
    Multi-language support
    Dangerous permissions

## How does it work? ##

Well, this is a very simple Android app. I actually put it here mostly as a showoff. Files in src/main/java/net/info420/fabien/androidtravailpratique are pretty well organised and straight-forward. Everything is super JavaDoc'd 'cause I had to much free time. Feel free to ask any question. As previously said, the whole app is **currently all doc'd in French** (see this README's first paragraph).

## Screenshots ##

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iN1ueqBpr02l5FfCejDwypB_kBnHp5MWS_RHLoPi-6Y/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google Slides presentation I made to show the app. I probably will change sharing settings one day, so if you need to see screenshots and the file is down, send me a message.
